TWAIN Application-Side Library
==============================

Info
--------------------------------------
This is a dotnet library created to work with [TWAIN](http://twain.org/) interface. 
This project follows these general goals:

* Supports all the TWAIN commands in the spec (or those that are possible)
* Eventally work on platforms other than Windows
 
The solution contains sample projects in both winforms and wpf. A nuget package is also
